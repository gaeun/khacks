        <h2>The Hackathon Experience</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>At a hackathon, participants work together for 24-36 hours to make new apps, websites, and machines from scratch. Don’t let the word “hack” scare you; it simply describes the innovative usage and development of various technologies. Hackers learn more about coding, problem solving, and teamwork, and all the while make their brilliant ideas a reality. They are provided with the resources necessary to do so as well; there are workshops, mentors, and plenty of chances to meet with other amazing developers who all wish to become better innovators. Participants walk away with not only improved programming and marketing skills, but also a community of hackers that they can share their passion with.</p>
            
            <h2>Why KHacks?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Organized and attended exclusively by high school students, KHacks is Korea’s first and only middle/high school hackathon. In a country where programming and innovating isn’t too popular, we understand that students lack opportunities to share their ideas amongst like-minded peers and learn to code from passionate mentors. At KHacks, we provide student developers, beginners and experts alike, this chance to compete and learn to actualise their boldest ideas. Open to all middle school and high school students who are interested in computer science, KHacks welcomes anyone who wants to create.
</p>
            
            <h2>Introducing Tracks</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>KHacks is introducing Tracks, a series of development options that you can choose from. This will allow you to receive more personalised help from mentors and workshops, and determine your eligibility for the appropriate resources and prizes.
Although we’ll be providing more details later on, there will be 4 tracks you can choose from this summer: Web Development, iOS Development, Android Development, and Hardware Development. We’re excited to see what you will create! 
</p>
            
            <h2>Come to Learn</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>KHacks cherishes the learning experience more than anything else. We believe that everyone, from individuals who have never written a line of code to experts who have experience developing, should be able to learn something from this event.
This is why we’re excited to announce our mentoring system. Throughout the hackathon, you’ll be able to request help from mentors either by briefly asking them to help you fix a bug, or by scheduling 30-minute-long office hours with them. Those who join the New Hackers track will be able to receive even more extensive support from mentors.
All participants will also be eligible to participate in introductory workshops and API workshops, where you will either learn about the basics of programming or learn how to integrate cool technologies into your app/website/hack.

                  <p>Then you’ve come to the right place! KHacks is open to any and all students, and we especially welcome beginners to take their first step into the world of programming. Workshops and mentors will also help you start and finish your project, and we ensure you that you’ll leave our hackathon having learned a lot.

                  <p>You’ll need to bring your laptop, a charger, your registration form, toiletries, and a couple changes of clothes. If you wish to sleep for a few hours during the event, we recommend that you bring a sleeping bag or blankets as well.
However, you don’t need a pre-determined team, an idea for your project, or food and drinks. KHacks will be providing plenty of food and chances to form teams and ideas.

                  <!-- <hr> -->
                  <p>Yes—in fact, we recommend that you work with a team, since it’s extremely challenging to create a functioning prototype by yourself in 24 hours, and because it doubles the fun. Teams can consist of 2-4 people, and you can look for more details in the registration form. You can also form a team at the event! KHacks has wonderful socialisation and team formation sessions.

<div class="col-md-4">

                  <p>Nope! You can come with an idea beforehand, but please don't start your hack until the hackathon officially begins.
